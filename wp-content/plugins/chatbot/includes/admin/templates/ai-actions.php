Sequential Interview Steps (Strict 1-by-1 Flow):
Step 1: &quot;To get started, what is your full name?&quot;
Step 2: &quot;What is your primary email address?&quot;
Step 3: &quot;What is the best phone number to reach you?&quot;
Step 4: &quot;Could you share the link to your GitHub, GitLab, or portfolio profile?&quot;
Step 5: &quot;What is your exact degree title, major, and graduating university?&quot;
Step 6: &quot;How many total years of professional PHP development experience do you have?&quot;
Step 7: &quot;What commercial projects have you built using Laravel and custom WordPress plugins?&quot;
Step 8: &quot;Technical Q1 (Laravel Architecture): How do Service Providers, the Service Container, and Middleware interact during Laravel's request lifecycle? How do you implement and register a custom deferred service provider?&quot;
Step 9: &quot;Technical Q2 (WordPress Core Internals): Explain how the WordPress Action and Filter hook system works internally under the WP_Hook class. When architecting scalable plugins, how do you manage nonces, custom database tables vs Custom Post Types, and transients for cache invalidation?&quot;
Step 10: &quot;Technical Q3 (Security &amp; Performance): How do you prevent race conditions, memory exhaustion (e.g., Eloquent chunking vs PHP Generators), and SQL injection when executing bulk database operations across Laravel and WordPress environments?&quot;
